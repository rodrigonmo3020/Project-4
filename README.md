# Project_4_Team5

**Overview**
This project focuses on the analysis of a dataset comprising 1904 patient IDs of individuals who have suffered from breast cancer. The dataset contains a wide range of information, including basic demographics such as age at diagnosis and type of cancer, as well as more complex data such as tumor characteristics, overall survival rate, menopausal stage, months of survival, and detailed genetic information. The primary goal of this analysis is to evaluate various factors that may impact treatment outcomes and survival rates in patients with breast cancer.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset includes the following key variables:

Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient in the dataset.
Age at Diagnosis: Age of the patient at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.
Type of Cancer: Specific subtype or type of breast cancer diagnosed.
Tumor Characteristics: Detailed information about the tumor, including size, stage, and grade.
Overall Survival Rate: Survival status of patients and their survival time in months.
Menopausal Stage: Menopausal status of the patients.
Genetic Information: Additional detailed genetic data related to breast cancer.

**Analysis Methods**
The analysis workflow includes the following steps:

Descriptive Statistics: Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.
Dynamic Visualizations: Utilizing Tableau for interactive and customized visualizations, including calculated fields and metrics.
Data Cleaning and Formatting: Removing irrelevant columns and standardizing value formats for consistency.
Machine Learning Model: Implementing a machine learning algorithm to predict survival rates with a 90% accuracy rate.
User-Friendly Tool: Creating a simple form based on the machine learning model to calculate survival rates based on user inputs.
Website Integration: Incorporating both the descriptive analysis and predictive model into a website using HTML code for user interaction.

**Contributions and Feedback**
Contributions to this project are welcome through pull requests. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, please open an issue in the repository.

One of the major limitations of this analysis is the lack of medical knowledge from the analysts and the limited details in the original dataset. The dataset was rich in genetic information, which presented challenges in defining its repercussions and understanding its full impact on treatment outcomes and survival rates.
